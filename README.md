# Text Pre-processing
Text pre-processing is the first and crucial step in NLP. It involves cleaning and transforming the raw text data into a format that can be easily analyzed. This section provides a detailed explanation of text pre-processing techniques, including:

1. Removing punctuations and special characters
2. Removing stop words
3. Stemming and Lemmatization
4. Removing HTML tags
   
# Text Representation
In NLP, text data needs to be transformed into numerical vectors for analysis. This section provides an overview of text representation techniques, including:

1. One-hot encoding
2. Term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF)
3. Word Embeddings
   
# Word2Vec
Word2Vec is a widely used word embedding technique that represents words in a high-dimensional vector space. This section provides a step-by-step guide to training and using Word2Vec models.

# Text Classification
Text classification is a popular NLP task that involves classifying text data into different categories based on its content. This section provides an in-depth explanation of text classification, including:

1. Types of text classification
2. Text feature extraction
3. Model selection and training
4. Evaluation metrics
   
# POS Tagging
POS (part-of-speech) tagging is the process of marking each word in a text with its corresponding part of speech. This section provides an introduction to POS tagging, including:

1. POS tag sets
2. POS tagging algorithms
   
# Conclusion:
This repository provides a comprehensive guide to NLP text processing and analysis, covering the essential topics in the field. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced NLP practitioner, this repository will help you improve your skills and knowledge.
